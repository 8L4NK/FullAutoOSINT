FullAutoOSINT (name is still TBD) is a proof of concept tool that is designed to help automate much of the OSINT process for pentesters.

As with any tool, it is not a replacement for human, but it can definately be used to supplement your own OSINT techniques.

It will make use of public/open resources commonly used by pentesters to obtain data such as: email addresses, usernames, passwords, host names, file metadata, phone numbers, and so on...


As with many tools, this is being developed and released under the MIT license as an open source tool for any and all people to be able to take and modify to suit their own needs.  Of course, pull requests are always welcomed.
